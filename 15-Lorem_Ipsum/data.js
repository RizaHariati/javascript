Beautiful lakeside towns like Bled at the foot of the Julian Alps calm the soul, while the capital of Ljubljana has a distinct small-town feel thanks to its picturesque Hapsburg architecture and tree-lined riverbanks.

The Blue Lagoon aside, there are so many thermal springs and waterfalls here that you’re bound to get one all to yourself with a bit of patience.

Get away from it all by setting your GPS for Montana’s Glacier National Park, and let the landscape do the rest. Six hours northwest from Yellowstone, Glacier is home to one of our planet’s most vulnerable natural wonders—run-off from nearby glaciers at its International Peace Park—as well as over 700 miles of hiking trails that reveal meadows and hidden lakes.",
