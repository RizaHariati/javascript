          <p class="text">
            The word papillon, meaning "butterfly," refers to the breed's
            fringed upright ears, which resemble a butterfly's outspread wings.
            The breed also comes in a drop-eared variety called the phalene,
            which means "moth," a cousin of the butterfly that folds its wings
            at rest. Both varieties can be sborn in the same litter, although
            the Papillon is the more popular and recognized variety.

            While he might be categorized by size as a lap dog, the bright,
            busy, and curious Papillon is no shrinking butterfly. If you want a
            dog to sit on your lap while you watch television, he's probably not
            the best choice. He's more likely to be flitting around looking for
            something to do and will happily rid your home and yard of any small
            rodents that might be lurking there. And this small dog in a sturdy
            package takes seriously his duties as family companion and guardian.
